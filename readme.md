Logical operators

* || (OR) The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols: result = a || b
* OR "||" finds the first truthy value The logic described above is somewhat classical.
* && (AND) The AND operator is represented with two ampersands &&:
* AND “&&” finds the first falsy value
